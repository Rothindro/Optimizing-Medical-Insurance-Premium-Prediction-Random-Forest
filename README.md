# Optimizing Medical Insurance Premium Prediction Through Machine Learning
---
## Overview:
Develop a machine learning model to predict medical insurance premiums for customers based on their input attributes, providing an efficient and accurate solution for handling online inquiries and applications.
Medical insurance companies receive numerous inquiries about premium costs due to online policy issues. Manually addressing these inquiries is time-consuming and inefficient. This project aims to build a predictive model that estimates premiums based on customer-specific features such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoking habits, and region.

In this project, we have utilized a dataset, which contains historical customer data who have taken medical insurance from XYZ company. The dataset includes metrics such as:

- __age:-__	Age of the person
- __sex:-__	The person is Male or Female
- __bmi:-__	Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat on height and weight
- __children:-__	How many children the person has who are included in the insurance
- __smoker:-__	The person is a smoker or not (Yes or No)
- __region:-__	From which region the person is
- __charges:-__	The premium for the insurance taken by the person (predictor variable)


The project will deliver a robust and scalable machine learning model capable of accurately predicting medical insurance premiums based on user inputs. By analyzing key attributes such as age, BMI, smoking habits, region, and other demographic or health-related factors, the model will provide personalized premium estimates, ensuring precision and reliability.
